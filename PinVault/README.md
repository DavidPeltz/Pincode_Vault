# PIN Vault v1.1 - Secure PIN Storage App

A mobile app built with React Native and Expo that allows users to securely store their bank and credit card PIN codes using a unique visual grid system with biometric authentication protection.

## üöÄ What's New in v1.1

### üîê Biometric Authentication
- **Enhanced Security**: Protect your PIN creation and editing with device biometrics
- **Multiple Auth Types**: Support for Face ID, Fingerprint, Iris recognition, and device PIN/password
- **Seamless Integration**: Uses your device's native authentication system
- **Optional Protection**: Authentication required only for sensitive operations

### üé® Theme System
- **Dark Mode**: Beautiful dark theme for comfortable viewing in low light
- **Light Mode**: Clean, bright interface for daytime use
- **Automatic Switching**: Remembers your theme preference
- **Enhanced Colors**: Improved color schemes for better accessibility

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Enhanced Security Information
- **Security Guide**: Built-in modal explaining how your data is protected
- **Best Practices**: Tips for maximum security and privacy
- **Authentication Status**: Clear indication of your device's security capabilities

## Features

### üîê Visual PIN Security
- **8x5 Color Grid**: Each PIN is stored in a randomly colored grid with 40 cells
- **Four Colors**: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow cells are evenly distributed
- **Hidden PIN**: Only you know which colored cells contain your actual PIN digits
- **Decoy Numbers**: Fill empty cells with random digits for additional security

### üì± User-Friendly Interface
- **Touch Interface**: Simply tap cells to enter PIN digits (0-9)
- **Visual Feedback**: PIN cells are highlighted with special borders
- **Real-time Preview**: See your PIN as you enter it
- **Card Naming**: Assign memorable names to each grid (e.g., "Chase Credit Card")
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes instantly

### üíæ Data Management
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored securely on your device using AsyncStorage
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete PIN grids
- **Automatic Saving**: Grids are saved with timestamps for easy organization
- **Biometric Protection**: Authentication required for editing and creating grids

### üé® Gallery View
- **Swipe Navigation**: Horizontally swipe through your saved grids
- **PIN Display**: Clearly see your PIN extracted from the grid
- **Edit/Delete**: Manage your grids with intuitive controls (requires authentication)
- **Pagination**: Visual indicators show your position in the gallery
- **Theme-Aware**: Beautiful appearance in both light and dark themes

## How It Works

### Security Concept
The app uses "security through obscurity" combined with device-level authentication. Your PIN is hidden among random digits in a colorful grid, and access to modify grids requires biometric verification. Even if someone sees your screen, they won't know which cells contain your actual PIN unless they know your system.

### Usage Workflow
1. **Authenticate**: Use biometric authentication to access editing features
2. **Create Grid**: Generate a new 8x5 grid with randomly distributed colors
3. **Enter PIN**: Tap colored cells to enter your PIN digits
4. **Fill Decoys**: Add random digits to remaining cells for camouflage
5. **Save**: Give your grid a memorable name and save it
6. **Access**: Use the gallery to swipe through and find your PINs

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^2.2.0",
  "@react-navigation/native": "^7.1.14",
  "@react-navigation/stack": "^7.4.2",
  "expo": "~53.0.17",
  "expo-local-authentication": "^16.0.5",

}
```

## Security Features

### Multi-Layer Protection
- **Biometric Authentication**: Device-level security for sensitive operations
- **Visual Obfuscation**: PINs hidden among decoy digits in colorful grids
- **Local Storage**: No cloud storage or external servers
- **Theme-Aware Security**: Security guidance integrated into the app interface

### Authentication Types Supported
- **Face ID** (iOS)
- **Touch ID** (iOS)
- **Fingerprint** (Android)
- **Iris Recognition** (Samsung devices)
- **Device PIN/Password/Pattern** (fallback)

### Security Considerations

#### Strengths
- **Multi-factor Protection**: Combines biometric auth with visual obfuscation
- **Device-Only Storage**: All data remains on your device
- **No Network Access**: Completely offline operation
- **Random Layouts**: Grid colors randomized for each new grid
- **Authentication Required**: Biometric verification for editing operations

#### Limitations
- **Device Security Dependency**: Security relies on your device's lock screen
- **Physical Access**: Still vulnerable to direct observation during use
- **No Cloud Backup**: Data loss possible if device is lost (by design)
- **Single Device**: No synchronization across multiple devices

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Use Different Colors**: Spread your PIN across different colored cells
2. **Memorable Patterns**: Choose colors in a pattern you can remember
3. **Regular Updates**: Regenerate grids periodically for maximum security
4. **External Backup**: Keep a secure backup of important PINs elsewhere
5. **Private Use**: Always use in private to prevent shoulder surfing
6. **Enable Authentication**: Ensure your device has biometric authentication set up

### Security Examples
- **Bank Debit**: PIN 1234 ‚Üí Enter 1 in red, 2 in blue, 3 in green, 4 in yellow
- **Credit Card**: PIN 9876 ‚Üí Enter 9 in green, 8 in red, 7 in blue, 6 in yellow
