- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across iOS and Android devices
- **Secure File Format**: Custom `.pvb` (PIN Vault Backup) format with header identification
- **Fallback Protection**: Graceful handling when advanced storage features aren't available

## Features

### üîê Visual PIN Security
- **8x5 Color Grid**: Each PIN is stored in a randomly colored grid with 40 cells
- **Four Colors**: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow cells are evenly distributed
- **Hidden PIN**: Only you know which colored cells contain your actual PIN digits
- **Decoy Numbers**: Fill empty cells with random digits for additional security

- **Import/Export**: Works even on fresh installations with no existing grids

### üì± User-Friendly Interface
- **Touch Interface**: Simply tap cells to enter PIN digits (0-9)
- **Visual Feedback**: PIN cells are highlighted with special borders
- **Real-time Preview**: See your PIN as you enter it
- **Card Naming**: Assign memorable names to each grid (e.g., "Chase Credit Card")
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes instantly
- **Header Access**: Backup functionality always available in the header

### üîê Enhanced Authentication
- **Multiple Auth Types**: Support for Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint, Iris, PIN, Pattern, Password
- **Flexible Requirements**: Authentication required only for sensitive operations
- **Setup Guidance**: Clear instructions for enabling device authentication
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Handles devices without biometric capabilities

### üé® Gallery View

- **PIN Display**: Clearly see your PIN extracted from the grid
- **Edit/Delete**: Manage your grids with intuitive controls (requires authentication)
- **Pagination**: Visual indicators show your position in the gallery
- **Theme-Aware**: Beautiful appearance in both light and dark themes

## How It Works

### Security Concept
The app uses "security through obscurity" combined with device-level authentication and encrypted backups. Your PIN is hidden among random digits in a colorful grid, access to modify grids requires biometric verification, and backups are protected with password-based encryption.

### Backup Security
- **Password-Based Encryption**: Uses PBKDF2-like key derivation with 10,000 rounds
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Backups work across different devices with the same password
- **Authentication Required**: Biometric verification needed for all backup/restore operations
- **Secure File Format**: Custom format prevents accidental data exposure

### Usage Workflow
1. **Authenticate**: Use device authentication to access editing features
2. **Create Grid**: Generate a new 8x5 grid with randomly distributed colors
3. **Enter PIN**: Tap colored cells to enter your PIN digits
4. **Fill Decoys**: Add random digits to remaining cells for camouflage
5. **Save**: Give your grid a memorable name and save it
6. **Backup**: Create encrypted backups with password protection
7. **Access**: Use the gallery to swipe through and find your PINs

## Security Features

### Multi-Layer Protection
- **Biometric Authentication**: Device-level security for sensitive operations
- **Encrypted Backups**: Password-protected backup files with strong encryption
- **Visual Obfuscation**: PINs hidden among decoy digits in colorful grids
- **Local Storage**: No cloud storage or external servers by default
- **Cross-Device Security**: Secure backup sharing between your devices

### Authentication Types Supported
- **Face ID** (iOS)
- **Touch ID** (iOS)
- **Fingerprint** (Android)
- **Iris Recognition** (Samsung devices)
- **Device PIN/Password/Pattern** (fallback)

### Backup Security
- **Password Protection**: Strong password required for backup encryption/decryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-like algorithm with 10,000 rounds
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Same password works across different devices
- **Authentication Gate**: Biometric verification required for all backup operations
- **Secure Storage**: User-controlled backup file locations

### Security Considerations

#### Strengths
- **Multi-factor Protection**: Combines biometric auth, visual obfuscation, and backup encryption
- **Device-Only Storage**: All data remains on your device unless you choose to backup
- **No Network Access**: Completely offline operation
- **Encrypted Backups**: Password-protected backup files for disaster recovery
- **Cross-Device Migration**: Secure way to move data between devices
- **User-Controlled Storage**: Choose where your backups are saved

#### Limitations
- **Device Security Dependency**: Security relies on your device's lock screen
- **Physical Access**: Still vulnerable to direct observation during use
- **Password Dependency**: Backup security depends on password strength
- **Single Password**: All backups use the same password system

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Use Different Colors**: Spread your PIN across different colored cells
2. **Memorable Patterns**: Choose colors in a pattern you can remember
3. **Strong Backup Passwords**: Use a strong, memorable password for backups
4. **Regular Backups**: Create backups before major device changes
5. **Secure Storage**: Save backups to trusted cloud services or secure locations
6. **Test Restores**: Verify your backups work before relying on them
7. **Private Use**: Always use in private to prevent shoulder surfing
8. **Enable Authentication**: Ensure your device has authentication set up

### Backup Workflow
1. **Create Backup**: Tap backup icon in header, authenticate, set password
2. **Choose Storage**: Select "Keep Local" for device storage or "Share/Export" for cloud
3. **Secure Password**: Use a strong password you can remember across devices
4. **Test Restore**: Verify backup works by testing restore process
5. **Regular Updates**: Create new backups when you add/modify grids

### Security Examples
- **Bank Debit**: PIN 1234 ‚Üí Enter 1 in red, 2 in blue, 3 in green, 4 in yellow
- **Credit Card**: PIN 9876 ‚Üí Enter 9 in green, 8 in red, 7 in blue, 6 in yellow
